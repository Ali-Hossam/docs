# Supported Stream Formats and Protocols

Even though Pipeless is defined as a computer vision framework, it is designed to allow you to analyze any kind of stream, including video, audio, subtitles, etc. These streams can be **analyzed and modified in real-time**. When analyzing a stream you can **export data and events** and when modifying you can generate a new stream with some changes to its content and the same encoding and format as the original one.

If you need a format that is not supported please open a [feature request](https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/issues/new?title=Feature%20Request%20%E2%80%9CYour%20Feature&labels=feature) or if you implemented a new format you can contribute by creating a pull request on GitHub.

## Computer vision / video processing

### Input

Pipeless supports almost **any protocol and format** (with several codecs) as input.

Supported input protocols: `v4l2` (for device webcam), `file`, `http(s)`, `rtmp`, `rtsp`, `rtp`, `tcp`, `udp`, `ftp`, ...
Supported input formats: `mp4`, `webm`, `mkv`, ... (several codecs supported for all of them)

### Output

When the output video is enabled, the following table describes the supported combinations of protocols and formats. New output protocols and formats are added constantly.

| Output Protocol | Output Format
| --------------- | ------------- |
| `screen`        | `raw` (Directly shown on the device screen) |
| `file`          | `mp4`         |
| `rtmp`          | `flv`         |

<Callout>
NOTE: When using `v4l2` as input URI to read from the device webcam, the output URI (if the output is enabled) **must** be `screen`. `v4l2` as input is supported in core versions >= `0.1.3-alpha`

## Audio recognition / audio processing

Audio processing is being implemented, however, not yet available.

## Data and Events

When analyzing streams to export data or events you have 2 options:

* **Manually**: You can define your custom export logic within the `process` or `post-process` hooks of your application.
* **Via Plugins**: You can use one of the available plugins and save the time of writing a custom logic. For example, Pipeless provides a Kafka plugin among others. Find the whole list of plugins in the [plugins section](/v0/plugins).
