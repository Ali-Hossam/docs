import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

You have to options when using Pipeless:

1. Install the requirements and Pipeless locally.
1. Use the Docker image which already ships all the required dependencies.

## Installing locally üíª

### Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python (tested with version `3.10.12`)
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

#### Note about macOS

The latest version of macOS (Ventura) comes with Python `3.9` by default. You can install version `3.10` with:

```bash copy
brew install python
```

Also, to install Gstreamer in macOS use the following instead of the upstream instructions to ensure all the required packages are installed:

```bash copy
brew install gstreamer
```

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

The following command installs the core (`pipeless-ai`) and the CLI (`pipeless-ai-cli`) into your system.

```bash copy
pip install pipeless-ai pipeless-ai-cli
```

Test the installation with:

```bash copy
pipeless --help
```

<Callout>
You may need to reload your shell for the new command to be available
</Callout>

## Using Docker üêã

```bash copy
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](/docs/v0/container).
