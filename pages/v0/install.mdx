# Installing Pipeless üõ†Ô∏è

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

You have two options when using Pipeless:

1. Install the requirements and Pipeless locally.
1. Use the Docker image which already ships all the required dependencies.

## Installing locally üíª

### Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python (tested with version `3.10.12`)
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

#### Note about macOS

The latest version of macOS (Ventura) comes with Python `3.9` by default. You can install version `3.10` with:

```bash copy
brew install python
```

Also, to install Gstreamer in macOS use the following instead of the upstream instructions to ensure all the required packages are installed:

```bash copy
brew install gstreamer
```

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Pipeless is provided in different flavors:

* **Default**: no inference runtime
* **ONNX CPU**: installs dependencies and allows to load models into the ONNX Runtime for running inference on **CPU**
* **ONNX GPU**: installs dependencies and allows to load models into the ONNX Runtime for running inference on **GPU**

The following command installs the core (`pipeless-ai`) and the CLI (`pipeless-ai-cli`) into your system:

* Default flavor:

    ```bash copy
    pip install pipeless-ai pipeless-ai-cli
    ```

* ONNX CPU flavor:

    ```bash copy
    pip install pipeless-ai[onnx-cpu] pipeless-ai-cli
    ```

* ONNX GPU flavor:

    ```bash copy
    pip install pipeless-ai[onnx-gpu] pipeless-ai-cli
    ```

Test the installation with:

```bash copy
pipeless --help
```

<Callout>
You may need to reload your shell for the new command to be available

## Using Docker üêã

```bash copy
docker run pipeless-ai/pipeless --help
```
