# Getting Started with Pipeless ðŸš€

Let's take a look at how to create a Pipeless project, the files it contains and how to use them. Make sure to have Pipeless and its requirements installed before continue.

## Create a Project

Run the following command:

```bash copy
pipeless create project my_awesome_project
```

The `create project` command will create a directory with the name of the project containing the following files:

* `app.py`: contains your `App` class. This file contains the implementation of your processing functions. For example, throwing inference on a CV model, editing a frame, etc. Within this file you will implement the hooks in charge of procesing the media frames.

* `config.yaml`: contains the configuration for each Pipeless component. You can also override all the configuration options via env vars starting with `PIPELESS_` followed by the option YAML path in capital letters. If defined, environment variables take precedence over the configuration file content. Find the whole list of configuration options in the [configuration](/configuration) section.

## Implementing Media Analysis/Processing

The processing steps are defined as methods of the `App` class. Pipeless loads the hooks you implement and it executes them at the proper time. All of them are optional, you just need to implement those required by your use case.

### Initial and Final Stages

These are executed just once per stream. They are tipically used when your app requires to execute some code before starting the processing of a stream or once the stream reaches its end.

- `before`: contains code that is executed before processing any content from a stream
- `after`: contains code that is executed after reaching the end of a stream.

### Processing Stages

These are the stages that actually modify/analyze/process the multimedia streams. All of them receive a frame and **must** return a frame (even if it is the same frame without modifications). The frames can be of any type(audio, video, text, metadata, ...).

- `pre_process`: code to execute to prepare a frame to be processed
- `process`: code for the actual frame processing
- `post-process`: code to execute after a frame is processed

These stages have been defined for a proper logical code structure.

### App internal state

The application maintains its own internal state. This is useful when you need to pass information between stages.

Simply use class variables within the `App` class.

```python copy
self.some_variable = "some_value"
```

## Running the App

To test your app execute the following from your app directory:

```bash copy
pipeless run
```

The above command will execute all the components by default. If you need to execute just one of the components use:

```bash copy
pipeless run <component>
```

where `<component>` must be one of `input`, `worker`, `output` or `all` (default).

### Core Components

Pipeless has been designed for easy local and edge execution but also, to easily deploy to the cloud. Thus, it is split in 3 main components:

* `input`: Receives the media streams, demux and decode the streams.
* `worker`: Receives raw media frames, and processes them according to the user app. You can deploy any number of workers and the processing will be load balanced automatically using a round robin schedule. When deployed to the cloud this allows to reach **real time** processing even with each frame takes relatively long times to process. Note in that case, that each worker executes the `before` and `after` stages and that each worker has a different instance of the running application.
* `output` (optional): Receives the processed raw media frames, encodes and mux them into the proper container format for the output protocol provided by the user

Each component runs with independence of the others.
