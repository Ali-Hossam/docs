# Troubleshooting üêû

* In case you see the input processed the whole stream but the output never reaches the end of the stream and the execution seems to get stuck, it is probably because the socket queues are discarding messages. Increase the worker and output socket queues by using `worker.recv_buffer_size` and `output.recv_buffer_size`. This is a common error when processing long videos locally, and it happens due to the accumulation of each frame processing delay. This won't happen if you deploy the application to the cloud, as the processing will be distributed among several workers, eliminating the accumulation of delay.

* If the pipeline doesn't start and there is no apparent error even on the debug logs run the following command changing `<path>` by your file path:

```bash copy
GST_DEBUG="*:3,GstVaapiPostproc:7,GstGLUploadElement:7" gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin uri=<path>.mp4 ! glimagesink
```

If you find errors or warnings on the output related to hardware acceleration it may be due to a GStreamer bug. Remove the `gstreamer1.0-vaapi` package and it should work:

```console
apt-get remove gstreamer1.0-vaapi
```
