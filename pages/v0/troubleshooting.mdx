# Troubleshooting üêû

* If the pipeline doesn't start and there is not apparent error even on the debug logs run the following command changing `<path>` by your file path:

```bash copy
GST_DEBUG="*:3,GstVaapiPostproc:7,GstGLUploadElement:7" gst-launch-1.0 uridecodebin uri=<path>.mp4 ! glimagesink
```

If you find errors or warnings on the output related to hardware acceleration it may be due to a GStreamer bug. Remove the `gstreamer1.0-vaapi` package and it should work:

```console
apt-get remove gstreamer1.0-vaapi
```
