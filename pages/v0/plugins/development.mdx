# Pipeless Plugin Development Guide

Developing a Pipeless plugin is really simple and almost the same as developing a Pipeless application. In this case, you have to implement the `PipelessPlugin` class.

Your plugin folder must have at least the following two files:

* `plugin.py`: the main plugin file. It **must** contain a class called `Plugin` that inherits from `PipelessPlugin`.

* `README.md`: the plugin usage documentation.

## Implementing the plugin

You can see the `PipelessPlugin` class as a special Pipeless application. The only differences are that it uses different hook names and that any method that you define within the `Plugin` class that **is not** a plugin hook will be exposed to the end user application under `self.plugins.plugin_id.method`. In this way, you can provide other Pipeless apps with some utility methods.

The hooks that you can implement are the same hooks as a normal Pipeless application but prefixed by `before` or `after`, indicating that the plugin hook will run before or after the actual application hook.

This allows your plugin to either receive some dynamic inputs from the end user application (when running after) or pass some values to the end user application (when running before).

Furthermore, just like when implementing a Pipeless application, the plugin hooks must return a frame, which will be the frame that the user application hook receives as a parameter.

The following is the list of hooks that you can implement on a plugin:

1. `before_before`
1. `after_before`
1. `before_pre_process`
1. `after_pre_process`
1. `before_post_process`
1. `after_post_process`
1. `before_after`
1. `after_after`

### `before_before` and `after_before` vs `__init__`

Be aware of an important difference between how the plugin `__init__` method and `xxx_before` hooks are executed:

* The **`__init__`** method is invoked **only once** per worker and **before marking the worker as ready**. This allows you to perform some preparation actions, such as downloading required files, opening connections to external services, etc.
* The **`xxx_before`** hooks are called **before the first frame of each stream**. Within the `xxx_before` hooks you can implement, for example, logic to reset the plugin state before each new stream.

### Implementation Example

Let's suppose we have a plugin with ID `example` and the following definition:

```python copy filename="plugin.py"
from pipeless_ai.lib.app.plugin import PipelessPlugin

class Plugin(PipelessPlugin):
    def before_process(self, frame):
        print('Custom process before the app process')
        return frame

    def say_hello(self):
        print('Hello!')
```

The above plugin will print `Custom process before the app process` just before running the app `process` hook and pass the frame to it. We could have made some changes to the frame, and then, an application using the plugin would receive a transformed frame.

Now, to say hello from an application that uses the plugin we can use `self.plugins.example.say_hello()` within the application `process` hook.

### Registering a Plugin

To make your plugin available to other Pipeless users through the Pipeless CLI, you need to register it on the Pipeless plugin registry.

You just need to add some metadata to a JSON file and create a GitHub Pull Request. Then, your plugin code must be publicly available on some Git repository and contain a version tag.

The `plugin install` command of the Pipelesss CLI will read your plugin metadata from that JSON file and download the plugin code from the provided repo URL.
You can specify several version entries on the metadata, each version **must** exist as a tag in the repository you provided. The Pipeless CLI will try to check out to a tag named as the version field when downloading the plugin code.

You can also provide any required dependencies, which can be other plugins, some Python dependencies (they will be automatically installed with pip when installing the plugin) or some system dependencies (need to be manually installed by the user).

The JSON file is located on the [Pipeless repo](https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless) under `cli/src/pipeless_ai_cli/plugins-registry.json`.

The following is the entry used by the Pipeless Kafka plugin:

```json
{
    "name": "Pipeless Kafka Plugin",
    "id": "kafka",
    "description": "Allows to produce messages to a Kafka topic",
    "versions": [
        {
            "version": "plugins-kafka-0.1.0",
            "latest": "true",
            "repo_url": "https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless.git",
            "subdir": "plugins/kafka",
            "plugin_dependencies": [],
            "python_dependencies": ["confluent-kafka@^2.0.0"],
            "system_dependencies": []
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Metadata considerations

* ID: **must** contain alphanumeric characters and underscores (`_`) only.
* The provided version **must** exist **as a tag** on the repository pointed by the `repo_url`.
* You can mark the latest version with `"latest": true`.
* The Python dependencies will be automatically installed when installing the plug-in. Each dependency can contain a specific version or the `^` version specifier.
* Plugin dependencies. (The automatic installation of plugin dependencies is not yet implemented, but should add them as metadata in the future).
* System dependencies: These dependencies will be shown when installing your plugin so the user can manually install them.
