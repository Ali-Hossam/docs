# Hello Pipeless!

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components';

Let's do the most basic stuff we can do with pipeless.

In this example we will edit a video on the fly to add some text and show the video in the screen while at the same time it is processed.

You can directly execute the example. To learn what each line of the application does on the [walkthrough section](#walkthrough).

## Requirements

* Pipeless: `pip install pipeless`

* NumPy: `pip install numpy`

* Pillow: `pip install Pillow`

<Callout>
    If you don't have the required dependencie for Pipeless installed check the [installation guide](/v0/install) or [use Docker](/v0/install#using-docker-) instead.
</Callout>

## Run the example

<Steps>
### Clone the repo

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/miguelaeh/pipeless
cd pipeless
```

### Move to the `examples/text-overlay` directory

``` bash copy
cd examples/text-overlay
```

### Configure your paths

Update `config.yaml` with the paths used within your system. They **must be absolute paths**. You need to edit the lines highlighted below:

```yaml {7}filename="config.yaml"
input:
  address:
    host: localhost
    port: 1234
  video:
    enable: true
    uri: file:///home/example/path/book-video.mp4
log_level: INFO
output:
  address:
    host: localhost
    port: 1237
  video:
    enable: true
    uri: screen
worker:
  n_workers: 1
```

### Run the application

Simply execute:

```bash copy
pipeless run
```

### Visualize the output

The video should appear on your screen as soon as you execute the `pipeless run` command since we set `screen` as video output URI.

## Walkthrough

This is a step by step description of what every line of the application code is doing.

In this example we only implement the `process` hook.

First , we create a pillow image from the frame array and define the text that will be drawn and the text font and color

```python copy
pil_image = Image.fromarray(frame)
text = "Hello pipeless!"
font = ImageFont.truetype(font='font.ttf', size=60)
text_color = (255, 0, 255)
```

Then, we simply draw the text image over our frame:

```python copy
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(pil_image)
    draw.text((800, 600), text, fill=text_color, font=font)
```

And finally, we return the modified frame as a NumPy array:

```python copy
    modified_frame = np.array(pil_image)
    return modified_frame
```
