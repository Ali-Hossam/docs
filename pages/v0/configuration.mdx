# Configuration

To configure your app you can use either env vars or a config file (`config.yaml`). When using env vars, they follow the structure `PIPELESS_` plus the configuration path in capital letter (See examples on the table below).

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout>
When using remote input **and** output video URIs, Pipeless will run as daemon (it will never stop) and it will process any number of consecutive streams that appear on the remote URI.
</Callout>

The following is the whole list of the currently supported configuration options:

## Skipping frames

When you are processing a stream in real-time using a device that does not have enough resources, you can enable frame skipping by setting `worker.skip_frames` to `true`.

This parameter indicates Pipeless to dynamically skip the `process` hook for some frames. The frames are selected depending on the previous frames' processing times and the frame rate of the input video stream.

The only hook that this option skips is the `process` hook or the model inference execution. In the rest of the hooks, like in pre-process or post-process, you can know when a frame has been or will be skipped by checking `self.skip_frame`.
In this way, you can still do some things in your application even when a frame is not processed. For example, you may want to count frames, so can add an `if-else` to simply count the frame in `pre-process` even if the processing is not executed for the frame, avoiding unnecessary overhead.

When a frame is skipped and you are using the inference runtime (loading a model), the `post-process` hook will contain the previous frame inference results. This is useful in cases where you are, for example, drawing bounding boxes, so you can countinuously print boxes on every single frame, even when it has not been processed, making the output video look better.
