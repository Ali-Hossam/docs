# Versions Notable Changes

This is a list of notable changes between versions. Since Pipeless uses semver, you won't typically find here breaking changes but notices about deprecations new configuration options, etc.

### Core version `0.1.10` and CLI version `0.1.8`

The plugin system was re-build. These versions include the new plugin system. If you were not using plugins, no changes are required.

If you were using plugins, please refer to the [new plugins docs](https://pipeless.ai/docs/v0/plugins)

### Core version `0.1.9` and CLI version `0.1.7`

The context has been replaced by class variables, thus, it is no longer used.

Required changes on your application code:

* Update your app methods to **NOT** receive the `ctx` parameter.
* Update any usage of the context, i.e. references to `ctx['xxx']` must be replaced by class variables, i.e. `self.xxx`.

## Core version `0.1.6-alpha` and CLI version `0.1.5-alpha`

These versions include a new **optional** parameter to configure the reception buffers of the sockets, which is useful to adjust the buffer sizes to the processing time.

With the above change, we also moved the **n_workers** option to the `worker` configuration section, which constitutes a **breaking change**. Since Pipeless is still in alpha, we are not increasing the major version.
