# Versions Notable Changes

This is a list of notable changes between versions. Since Pipeless uses semver, you won't typically find here breaking changes but notices about deprecations new configuration options, etc.

## Core version `0.1.6-alpha` and CLI version `0.1.5-alpha`

These versions include a new **optional** parameter to configure the reception buffers of the sockets, which is useful to adjust the buffer sizes to the processing time.

With the above change, we also moved the **n_workers** option to the `worker` configuration section, which constitutes a **breaking change**. Since Pipeless is still in alpha, we are not increasing the major version.
