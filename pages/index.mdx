Welcome to the Pipeless documentation!

## What is Pipeless?

Pipeless is an **open-source** computer vision framework that ships all the features you need to create and deploy efficient computer vision applications that work in real-time. Just like you implement specific functions in serverless web applications, Pipeless simply requires you to implement certain hooks to process any stream from any source.

With Pipeless, you can deploy either on edge devices or to the cloud thanks to our container images, and it also provides a built-in communication layer to boost the stream processing speed to any desired framerate out-of-the-box, by automatically distributing the frame processing without using brokers.

Pipeless provides industry-standard models that you can use out-of-the-box or easily bring your own custom model. The Pipeless worker contains a built-in ONNX Runtime allowing you to run inference using any compatible model.

Furthermore, you can easily extend the feature set thanks to the plugins system. For example, there are plugins to handle events in real-time with Kafka, use YOLOv8 models, automatically draw inference results over the original video, and many others.

As an example, you can build simple things like this:

<video playsInline autoPlay muted loop>
    <source src="https://pipeless.ai/cats.mp4" />
    It seems your browser doesn't support the video tag.
</video>

With just these lines of code:

```python copy filename="app.py"
from pipeless_ai.lib.app.app import PipelessApp
import cv2

class App(PipelessApp):
    def before(self):
        xml_data = cv2.CascadeClassifier('cats.xml')
        self.xml_data = xml_data

    def process(self, frame):
        model = self.xml_data
	bounding_boxes = model.detectMultiScale(frame, minSize = (30, 30))
        for box in bounding_boxes:
            a, b, width, height = box
            cv2.rectangle(frame, (a, b), (a + width, b + height), (255, 0, 255), 2)

        return frame
```

## Where to start?

Nobody likes to read docs, so you can start by running some of the examples and checking/modifying their code. If you need more context on what is happening, you can come back to the getting started guide and learn from the basics.

In the rare case in which you are one of those persons who read the docs, we hope you enjoy the guides! Any feedback on the docs is really appreciated! You can also contribute to the docs by clicking on the links at the right menu.

## Documentation Versions

Pipeless versioning follows the semver standard, except for versions annotated with `alpha` or `beta`, which may include breaking changes without a major version bump.
