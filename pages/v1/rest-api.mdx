# Pipeless REST API

This section of the docs describes the available endpoints that are available for a running Pipeless instance.

When you start a Pipeless instance you can manage its resources via the CLI but also via the
REST API. Actually, the CLI is a wrapper around the REST API.

By default Pipeless uses port `3030` and listens  at `0.0.0.0`. That means Pipeless is available from all the network interfaces of the machine.
The URL and port to use is also shown at the top of the Pipeless logs, just after loading the stages.

## Endpoints

### `/streams`

| Method   | Endpoint | Description |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| `GET`    | `/`      | Returns the complete list of streams that Pipeless is aware of. Each stream includes `id`, `input_uri`, `output_uri`, `frame_path` and `restart_policy`, among other fields. |
| `POST`   | `/`      | Creates a new stream. It must contain `input_uri`, `output_uri`, `frame_path` and optionally `restart_policy` (`never` by default). |
| `PUT`    | `/<id>`  | Updates a stream identified by `<id>`. It can contain `input_uri`, `output_uri`, `frame_path` or `restart_policy`. |
| `DELETE` | `/<id>`  | Deletes the stream represented by the specified `<id>`. |
