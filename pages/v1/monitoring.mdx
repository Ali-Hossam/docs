# Exporting events and monitoring

In order to export events and monitor what is happening on your Pipeless streams you can configure a Redis publisher connection.

The following env vars are required:

- `PIPELESS_REDIS_URL`: URL of the remote Redis instance where to push the events.
- `PIPELESS_REDIS_CHANNEL`: Name of the Redis channel where Pipeless should send the events.

Then, start pipeless with the flag `--export-events-redis`:

```bash
pipeless start --project-dir /my-project --export-redis-events
```
