# Object tracking - YOLO SDK and Norfair

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components';

This example makes use of a YOLO model with the Ultralytics SDK to detect objects and then a Norfair tracker to track their position. You can achieve the same result with any object detector, including the example with [ONNX Runtime](/v1/examples/onnx-yolo).

In this case we connect two Pipeless stages making use of the `user-data` field of the frames to store the detections on the first stage and read them in the second.

## Requirements

## Requirements

* Pipeless: Check the [installation guide](/v1/getting-started/installation).

* Python OpenCV, NumPy, Ultralytics and Norfair packages. Install them by running:

```bash copy
pip install opencv-python numpy ultralytics norfair
```

## Run the example

<Steps>

### Create an empty Pipeless project

```bash copy
pipeless init my-project --template empty # Using the empty template we avoid the interactive shell
cd my-project
```

> Feel free to change `my-project` by any name you want.

### Download the stage folders

In this example we use two different stages. One is the same as the [YOLO example](/v1/examples/yolo) one and the other is the stage that performs the actual tracking.

```bash copy
wget -O - https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 "pipeless-main/examples/yolo"
wget -O - https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 "pipeless-main/examples/object-tracking"
```

### Start Pipeless

The following command leaves Pipeless running on the current terminal

```bash copy
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

### Provide a stream

In this case we concat the two stages. The first stage takes care of performing object detection with YOLO and
passes that data to the next stage. The second stage takes care of performing the object tracking with Norfair.
Note the list of stages passed as `frame-path`.

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash copy
pipeless add stream --input-uri "v4l2" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "yolo,object-tracking"
```

This command assumes you have a webcam available, if you don't just change the input URI to a file with `file:///home/my-user/my-file`.

</Steps>
