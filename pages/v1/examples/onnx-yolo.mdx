# ONNX Runtime - Object detection with YOLO

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components';

This example makes use of the ONNX Runtime to run object detection using a YOLO model.

The YOLO ONNX model was obtained by simply exporting the YOLOv8n model to the ONNX format.

<Callout>
This example was created to demonstrate how to load an ONNX model in Pipeless, thus, the post-processing code is not optimized.
You can verify that the actual inference times on this example (ONNX Runtime) and the example that uses the Ultralytics
SDK (Pytorch) are exactly the same, the only difference is in the post-processing implementation.
</Callout>

## Requirements

* Pipeless: Check the [installation guide](/v1/getting-started/installation).

* Python OpenCV and NumPy packages. Install them by running:

```bash copy
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Run the example

<Steps>

### Create an empty Pipeless project

```bash copy
pipeless init my-project --template empty # Using the empty template we avoid the interactive shell
cd my-project
```

> Feel free to change `my-project` by any name you want.

### Download the stage folder

```bash copy
wget -O - https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 "pipeless-main/examples/onnx-yolo"
```

### (Optional) If you have CUDA or TensorRT installed you can enable them at `process.json`

```json {5}filename="process.json"
{
    "runtime": "onnx",
    "model_uri": "https://pipeless-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/yolov8n.onnx",
    "inference_params": {
        "execution_provider": "tensorrt"
    }
}
```

### Start Pipeless

The following command leaves Pipeless running on the current terminal

```bash copy
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

### Provide a stream

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash copy
pipeless add stream --input-uri "v4l2" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "onnx-yolo"
```

This command assumes you have a webcam available, if you don't just change the input URI.
