# Multi-pose estimation with TensorFlow

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components';

In this example, we will track the pose of a person during the video and draw keypoints over the image.
In this case, we make use of the `pipeless_ai_tf_models` package to import the [multipose estimation model](/v0/models/tensorflow/multi-pose-estimation), we don't even have to bring our own model, everything is ready to use.

## Requirements

* Pipeless: Check the [installation guide](/v1/getting-started/installation).

* Python OpenCV package. Install it by running:

```bash copy
pip install opencv-python
```

## Run the example

<Steps>

### Create an empty Pipeless project

```bash copy
pipeless init my-project
cd my-project
```

> Feel free to change `my-project` by any name you want.

### Download the stage folder

```bash copy
wget -O - https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/archive/main.tar.gz | tar -xz --strip=2 "pipeless-main/examples/tf-pose"
```

### Start Pipeless

The following command leaves Pipeless running on the current terminal

```bash copy
pipeless start --stages-dir .
```

### Provide a stream

Open a new terminal and run:

```bash copy
pipeless add stream --input-uri "https://pipeless-public.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/woman-walking.mp4" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "tf-pose"
```
