# Passing custom data (per frame) between hooks and stages

import { Steps, Callout } from 'nextra/components';

This example contains boilerplate code that you can use to learn how to associate custom data to a frame. That custom data can be obtained back from other hooks of the same stage and even from hooks of subsequent stages.

Note this mechanism allows you to associate data to a single frame. If you need data that will be shared by all frames check the [KV store documentation](/v1/kvstore).

## Example

This example contains boilerplate code that you can find [here](https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/tree/main/examples/custom-data).

To assign custom data to a frame such as bounding boxes results, masks, or anything you like, you just need to set `frame_data['user_data']`. It accepts any type as value. The only restriction is that, if you set a dictionary as value, al the keys must be strings. Some examples:

* Integers:
    ```python copy
    frame_data['user_data'] = 100
    ```
* Floats:
    ```python copy
    frame_data['user_data'] = 100.5
    ```
* Strings:
    ```python copy
    frame_data['user_data'] = "Hello!"
    ```
* Heterogeneus arrays:
    ```python copy
    frame_data['user_data'] = ["string", 13, 34.6]
    ```
* Heterogeneus Dictionaries (IMPORTANT: all keys must be strings):
    ```python copy
    frame_data['user_data'] = {
        "key1": 0,
        "key2": [1, "3"],
        "key3": { "inner1": "hola" }
    }
    ```
With that, in later hooks (either from the same stage or other) you can obtain back the data just accessing that field:

```python copy
my_data = frame_data['user_data']
```

In order to connect two or more stages, simply pass the list of stage names to the `add stream` command under the `frame-path` option. For example:

```bash copy
pipeless add stream --input-uri "file:///home/user/my/path.mp4" --output-uri "screen" --frame-path "stage1,stage2"
```

Using the above command, if you added data to the frame `user_data` field in a hook of `stage1` you will be able to use it in the hooks of `stage2`.
