# Restart Policy

The restart policy allows you to indicate if and when the processing of a stream should restart. The main
events that may occur when processing a stream are an error or reaching its end.

For example, if Pipeless is reading a stream via RTSP, an error may occur if the connection fails. On
the other hand, if the RTSP source stops sending the stream, Pipeless will eventually reach the end of the
stream after processing the last frame. After the end of a stream, the RTSP source could start producing a
second stream that you may also want to process.

You can specify the restart policy when adding or updating a stream via the `--restart-policy`
option of the CLI or the `restart_policy` field of the JSON payload when using the REST API.

The possible values are:

* `Never` (default): indicates that the processing won't be restarted.
* `OnError`: indicates that the processing will restart when it stops due to an error.
* `OnEos`: indicates that the processing will restart when it reaches the end of the stream in order to start processing any possible new stream.
* `Always`: indicates that the processing will restart always, regardless of the cause of the stop.
