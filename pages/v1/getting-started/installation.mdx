# Installing Pipeless üõ†Ô∏è

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

You have two options when using Pipeless:

1. Install the requirements and Pipeless locally.
1. Use the Docker image which already ships all the required dependencies.

## Installing locally üíª

### Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python (tested with version `3.10.12`)
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`.

#### Install dependencies for Linux

* Python:

    ```bash copy
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    ```

* Gstreamer:

    Follow the installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python) or just run:

    ```bash copy
    sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
        libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools \
        gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 \
        gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev
    ```

#### Install dependencies for macOS

The latest version of macOS (Ventura) comes with Python `3.9` by default. You can install version `3.10` with:

```bash copy
brew install python
```

Also, to install Gstreamer in macOS use the following instead of the upstream instructions to ensure all the required packages are installed:

```bash copy
brew install gstreamer
```

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Pipeless has an installer script that automatically grabs the latest version and installs it locally.

```bash copy
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or you can fetch the script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```bash copy
curl -fsSL -o install_pipeless.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh
chmod 700 install_pipeless.sh
./install_pipeless.sh
```

Finally, test the installation with:

```bash copy
pipeless --help
```

## Using Docker üêã

No installation is required when using Docker, you just need to have docker installed.

```bash copy
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```
