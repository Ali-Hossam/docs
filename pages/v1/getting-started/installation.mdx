# Installing Pipeless üõ†Ô∏è

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

You have two options when using Pipeless:

1. Install the requirements and Pipeless locally.
1. Use the Docker image which already ships all the required dependencies.

## Installing locally üíª

### Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python.
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`.

<Callout>
Please note that the pre-built binaries are linked to specific Python versions. `3.10` for Linux, `3.12` for macOS.
If your installed version is different provide `--build` to the installation script.
</Callout>

#### Install dependencies for Linux

* Python:

    ```bash copy
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    ```

* Gstreamer:

    Follow the installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python) or just run:

    ```bash copy
    sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
        libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools \
        gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 \
        gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio gstreamer1.0-rtsp libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev
    ```

#### Install dependencies for macOS

```bash copy
brew install python
```

Also, to install Gstreamer in macOS use the following instead of the upstream instructions to ensure all the required packages are installed:

```bash copy
brew install gstreamer
```

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

The provided installation script grabs the latest Pipeless version from the pre-built releases and installs it locally. You can use the script to either **install** or **upgrade** your Pipeless version.
In case there is not a pre-built binary for your target OS or architecture the script will try to build Pipeless from source.
You can also force the build from source using the `--build` flag.

<Callout>Note the pre-built binaries of Pipeless are built against Python 3.12 for macOS and 3.10 for Linux. If you have a different Python version either update it to the mentioned ones or provide the `--build` flag to the script to build Pipeless for your installed Python version</Callout>

```bash copy
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or you can fetch the script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```bash copy
curl -fsSL -o install_pipeless.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh
chmod 700 install_pipeless.sh
./install_pipeless.sh
```

<Callout>
Remember to add the commands shown at the end of the installation to your shell configuration file, so Pipeless can be run in future shell sessions.
</Callout>

Finally, test the installation with:

```bash copy
pipeless --help
```

## Using Docker üêã

No installation is required when using Docker, you just need to have docker installed.

```bash copy
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](/v1/container).

## Building from source

Apart from the Pipeless dependencies listed in the [requirements](#requirements) you need to install `pkg-config` and `cargo`.

<Callout>
If Microsoft does not provide a ONNX runtime build for your target platform go to
the [next section](/v1/getting-started/installation#building-onnx-runtime-from-source). You can check the
ONXX Runtime releases at: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/releases
</Callout>

Once the dependencies are installed run the following from the root of the Pipeless repository:

### Linux

```bash copy
export PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR="${HOME}/.pipeless"
cargo build --all --release --manifest-path pipeless/Cargo.toml
mv pipeless/target/release/pipeless-ai pipeless/target/release/pipeless
strip pipeless/target/release/pipeless
mv pipeless/target/release/{pipeless,libonnxruntime*} "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/"
```

Include `PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR` in your `PATH` **and** `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

### macOS

```bash copy
export PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR="${HOME}/.pipeless"
cargo build --all --release --manifest-path pipeless/Cargo.toml
mv pipeless/target/release/pipeless-ai pipeless/target/release/pipeless
strip pipeless/target/release/pipeless
mv pipeless/target/release/{pipeless,libonnxruntime*} "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/"
install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/pipeless"
```

Include `PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR` in your `PATH`.

## Building ONNX Runtime from source

When you build Pipeless it will automatically download and link to a pre-built ONNX Runtime library obtained from the Microsoft releases.
However, it may happen that Microsoft does not release a pre-built library for your target platform. When that's the case, please follow the below instructions to build both ONNX Runtime and Pipeless.

First, clone the ONNX Runtime repo as follows and move to the proper branch:

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime.git
cd onnxruntime
git checkout v1.16.3
git submodule update
```

Then, build it as follows:

<Callout>
If you get out-of-memory running the following command remove the `--parallel` option or change it to a low value such as `--parallel 2`. It will take significantly more time to build, but you will not run out of memory.
</Callout>

```bash copy
# You can remove CUDA and Cudnn flags if you do not plan to use CUDA.
bash build.sh --parallel --build_shared_lib --config Release --use_cuda --cuda_home /usr/local/cuda/ --cudnn_home /usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/
```

Now let's move the built library into the Pipeless install directory. Run the following, still from inside the ONNX repo root:

```bash copy
mkdir ~/.pipeless
cp ./build/Linux/Release/libonnxruntime*.so ~/.pipeless/
```

Now, move out of the ONNX runtime repository and clone the Pipeless repository:

```bash copy
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless.git
cd pipeless
```

Build Pipeless with the following command, which will link it to the ONNX Runtime library you built before:

```bash copy
ORT_STRATEGY=system ORT_LIB_LOCATION=~/.pipeless/ cargo build --manifest-path pipeless/Cargo.toml --release
mv pipeless/target/release/pipeless-ai pipeless/target/release/pipeless
strip pipeless/target/release/pipeless
cp pipeless/target/release/pipeless ~/.pipeless/
```

Finally run the following so you can start using Pipeless:

For Linux:

```bash copy
export PATH="${HOME}/.pipeless:${PATH}"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${HOME}/.pipeless:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
```

For macOS:

```bash copy
export PATH="${HOME}/.pipeless:${PATH}"
install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/pipeless
```

<Callout>
Copy paste the above `export` commands in your `~/.bashrc` or whatever file you use so Pipeless can be used in future sessions. If on macOS you do NOT have to copy the `install_name_tool` command in your profile.
</Callout>
