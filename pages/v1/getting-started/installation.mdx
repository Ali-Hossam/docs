# Installing Pipeless 🛠️

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

You have two options when using Pipeless:

1. Install the requirements and Pipeless locally.
1. Use the Docker image which already ships all the required dependencies.

## Installing locally 💻

### Requirements ☝️

* Python (tested with version `3.10.12`)
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`. Installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python)

#### Note about macOS

The latest version of macOS (Ventura) comes with Python `3.9` by default. You can install version `3.10` with:

```bash copy
brew install python
```

Also, to install Gstreamer in macOS use the following instead of the upstream instructions to ensure all the required packages are installed:

```bash copy
brew install gstreamer
```

### Installation 🛠️

Run the following command to install Pipeless:

```bash copy
TODO
```

Test the installation with:

```bash copy
pipeless --help
```

## Using Docker 🐋

No installation is required when using Docker, you just need to have docker installed.

```bash copy
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](/v1/container).
