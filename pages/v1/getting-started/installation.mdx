# Installing Pipeless üõ†Ô∏è

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

You have two options when using Pipeless:

1. Install the requirements and Pipeless locally.
1. Use the Docker image which already ships all the required dependencies.

## Installing locally üíª

### Requirements ‚òùÔ∏è

* Python.
* **Gstreamer 1.20.3**. Verify with `gst-launch-1.0 --gst-version`.

<Callout>
Please note that the pre-built binaries are linked to specific Python versions. `3.10` for Linux, `3.12` for macOS.
If your installed version is different provide `--build` to the installation script.
</Callout>

#### Install dependencies for Linux

* Python:

    ```bash copy
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    ```

* Gstreamer:

    Follow the installation instructions [here](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/installing/index.html?gi-language=python) or just run:

    ```bash copy
    sudo apt-get install libgstreamer1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev \
        libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev gstreamer1.0-plugins-base \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
        gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools \
        gstreamer1.0-x gstreamer1.0-alsa gstreamer1.0-gl gstreamer1.0-gtk3 \
        gstreamer1.0-qt5 gstreamer1.0-pulseaudio gstreamer1.0-rtsp libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev
    ```

#### Install dependencies for macOS

```bash copy
brew install python
```

Also, to install Gstreamer in macOS use the following instead of the upstream instructions to ensure all the required packages are installed:

```bash copy
brew install gstreamer
```

### Installation üõ†Ô∏è

Pipeless has an installer script that automatically grabs the latest version and installs it locally.
The script can also be used to easily update to new versions.
In case there is not a pre-built binary for your target OS or architecture the script will try to build Pipeless from source.
You can also force the build from source using the `--build` flag. This is useful in cases when you want to build Pipeless linking to your specific Python version.
In case Pipeless needs to built from source, the script will guide you on installing required dependencies.

```bash copy
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or you can fetch the script, and then execute it locally. It's well documented so that you can read through it and understand what it is doing before you run it.

```bash copy
curl -fsSL -o install_pipeless.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pipeless-ai/pipeless/main/install.sh
chmod 700 install_pipeless.sh
./install_pipeless.sh
```

<Callout>
Remember to add the commands shown at the end of the installation to your shell configuration file, so Pipeless can be run in future shell sessions.
</Callout>

Finally, test the installation with:

```bash copy
pipeless --help
```

## Using Docker üêã

No installation is required when using Docker, you just need to have docker installed.

```bash copy
docker run miguelaeh/pipeless --help
```

Find the whole container documentation [here](/v1/container).

## Building from source

Apart from the Pipeless dependencies listed in the [requirements](#requirements) you need to install `pkg-config` and `cargo`.

Once the dependencies are installed run the following from the root of the Pipeless repository:

### Linux

```bash copy
export PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR="${HOME}/.pipeless"
cargo build --all --release --manifest-path pipeless/Cargo.toml
mv pipeless/target/release/pipeless-ai pipeless/target/release/pipeless
strip pipeless/target/release/pipeless
mv pipeless/target/release/{pipeless,libonnxruntime*} "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/"
```

Include `PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR` in your `PATH` **and** `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

### macOS

```bash copy
export PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR="${HOME}/.pipeless"
cargo build --all --release --manifest-path pipeless/Cargo.toml
mv pipeless/target/release/pipeless-ai pipeless/target/release/pipeless
strip pipeless/target/release/pipeless
mv pipeless/target/release/{pipeless,libonnxruntime*} "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/"
install_name_tool -add_rpath @executable_path "${PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR}/pipeless"
```

Include `PIPELESS_INSTALL_DIR` in your `PATH`.
