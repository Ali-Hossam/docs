# Ready to use CV Models

We provide some packages containing a growing set of out-of-the-box models for common cases. You can use them to develop your applications as fast as writing a couple lines of code. Each module has its own documentation, find the list below.

Each model implements an interface to be used with Pipeless but can they be used anywhere (even without using the Pipeless).

You will find a package per framework/library in order to maintain each package as light as possible.

Using these models **is NOT mandatory** and **you can use your own ones**.

### Tensorflow based models

* [Multi-pose estimation](/v1/models/tensorflow/multi-pose-estimation): Detects up to 6 people. Returns bounding boxes for the people and 17 keypoints (nose, left eye, right eye, left ear, ...)
