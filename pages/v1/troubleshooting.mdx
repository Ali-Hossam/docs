# Troubleshooting üêû

## Python can't find installed pip packages

When you installed some pip package and Pipeless reports that they can't be found, most likely your `pip` binary is
linked to a different Python version than the `pipeless` binary.
The easiest way to solve this is to re-install pipeless providing the `--build` flag to the installation
script. You can also re-run the `pip install` with the correct pip binary usually available under `/usr/bin/pip3.X` where `x` is the Python minor version.

## Pipeless cannot find the ONNX Runtime library

This usually happens when you are installing with a target platform for which Microsoft does not provide a pre-build ONNX runtime.

In this case you will see a message similar to the following:

```
/root/.pipeless/pipeless: error while loading shared libraries: libonnxruntime.so.1.16.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

Please check [this section](/v1/getting-started/installation#building-onnx-runtime-from-source) of the installation guide to correctly re-install pipeless.
